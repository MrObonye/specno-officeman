This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.7.

The purpose of this assignment is to assess my Angular knowledge. It covers the following topics: 
- Component design 
- Communicating between components 
- Type safety 
- Services 
- Angular routing 
- Modules and lazy loading 
- Manipulating Objects 
- Interfacing with a Firebase backend 
- State management with NgRx.

My objective is to complete all tasks to the best of my ability. Ensuring great code quality, neatness, comments, naming conventions, implementation of logic, and an ability to solve problems. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
